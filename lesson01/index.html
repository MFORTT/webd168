                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey! My name is Michelle! I’m a full-time student studying Cybersecurity, and I love learning how technology works and how to keep systems safe and secure. I’m also really into web design and coding, and I enjoy creating websites that are clean, modern, and functional.

                Outside of school, fitness is a huge part of my life. I love working out, training, and even competing in fitness competitions, it keeps me motivated, focused, and strong. I’m also a personal trainer on the side, helping people reach their goals and feel more confident in their bodies. I also work part-time doing billing and operations for my dad’s pest control company.

                Family means everything to me. My sister and her three kids recently moved to San Diego, and I help take care of them, picking the kids up from school, spending time together, and supporting my sisters whenever I can. I also love hanging out with my boyfriend, relaxing, and finding new places to eat because, honestly, I love food, especially trying new restaurants or anything with amazing flavor.
                When I get the chance, I love to travel to tropical places, soak up the sun, and just unwind. I’m passionate about growing, learning, and creating a life that blends my love for family, fitness, food, and technology.</p>

                <h2>Prior Experience</h2>
                <p>I've been developing my skills in web design and coding through several courses and personal projects. I've taken classes in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Python. I've also worked on hands-on projects such as building multi-page websites using semantic HTML5 and external CSS, adding interactive elements with JavaScript, and managing version control with GitHub Pages.

                Outside of class, I've practiced designing and updating websites for small family businesses, using what I've learned to improve layouts, fix links, optimize images, and add SEO-friendly content. Helping family members and friends with their websites has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and see the impact of my work.</p>
